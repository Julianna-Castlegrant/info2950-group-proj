##DATASET IDEAS:
 **Idea 1: Guiding Eyes for the Blind Puppy Raising Program for Blind People**
* The main idea for this project is to compare the locations that dogs are raised to their success rate for passing to become a guide dog, as well as factors that play into this success such as gender, parents, when they were born, how old they were when taking the exam, etc.
* This data is very attainable due to having members in the group with special access to a large dataset.
* This dataset contains all information regarding Guiding Eyes dogs from 2020-current. (1153 individual data pieces) 
* In addition, data prior to 2020 can be attained if needed.
* The dataset contains information such as “Date, Name, DogID#, Breed, Gender, Father, Mother, DateBorn, Status, Region.”
* These data categories allow for several analyses to occur based on specific dog breeds as well as regional across the United States.
* On a wider spectrum, data could be collected from other organizations that raise dogs for the blind, which could lead to cross-organizational analysis.

**Idea 2: NHL Penalty Minutes**
* The idea for this was to compare penalty minutes obtained by a team in the 21-22 season and games lost to see if there was any sort of correlation between them.
* Penalties in hockey are ambiguous in nature but our group was going to attempt to link penalties to aggression, and the idea of if being an aggressive player gives your team the edge in winning games.
* There is a lot of data available about penalty minutes split up by team, player, and position. We could look at websites such as statmuse or go to the actual game reports from each team throughout the season.
* We could also go back farther to the 18-19 season (before Covid)
* Using this data we can see which player from which team had the most minutes and how that could have possibly affected the team.

**Idea 3: Starbucks vs Seasons**
 * For this, we were thinking about how Starbucks really hypes up certain seasonal releases throughout the year. For example, we have seen many social media advertisements lately for the return of Pumpkin Spice. But it made us wonder if Starbucks had a most anticipated release by consumers, and how to determine that via their sales throughout the year.
* The conclusion of this analysis may help Starbucks focus their attention and resources more on their most popular season.
* Our group personally thinks the Pumpkin Spice release and the Christmas flavor releases will go neck and neck for most anticipated, but this is based off of the ads we remember seeing and our personal preferences.
* This kind of data is available but it will be harder to aggregate. For instance, we can get data on their sales reports from their financial reports, but that is not as easy as finding csv files. When looking for just dataset files, we found some on revenue distribution of Starbucks from 2009 to 2021, by product type. Finding daily or monthly sales numbers are harder to comeby (we have not found one yet), but if we get that then we can use daily sales and compare to the timeline of Starbucks seasonal releases. These exact release dates we would google (i.e. PSL is released on August 30th), and we can theoretically add an additional column to our data frame to categorize the dates by what season they are a part of.

##Questions for Reviewers:
* How many individual data pieces are needed to make a good dataset to analyze?
* Please let us know your opinions on the scope of data specifically for Idea 1 (Guiding Eyes).
* When cleaning our data, if there are several individual data pieces that are removed, at what point should we look for a larger master dataset to begin with?
