We then persistently reached out to multiple staff members of Guiding Eyes for the Blind via phone calls, text messages, and email. We contacted the organization's Regional Director of the Finger Lakes Region, numerous contacts through their Business Department, and even the Director of Canine Program Development. However, we were either told that they could not find the old data despite their efforts, or our attempts at communication were left unanswered. Even when we moved on to contacting every Guide Dog Training program whose headquarters was in New York and New Jersey (to potentially run a comparison of other guide dog organization success compared to Guiding Eyes for the Blind success), we were either sent to voicemail or we got no updates from the people we contacted. The point of mentioning this is to show the immense effort that went into collecting and expanding our Guiding Eyes data."

    "In the original dataset, we did not have any dogs who had a graduation date but had the status of \"Released\". So we used to define “Released” as \"dog has not passed their exam and has since been put up for adoption for the general public\". However, now we redefine \"Released\" to be \"Dog who may or may not have passed their exam (if they have a listed graduation date then they did pass) but has since been put up for adoption for the general public\". This is because, upon further evaluation, we realized that a dog who has a graduation date but is listed as \"Released\" is a dog who did indeed pass the final exam and graduated, but has since been put up for adoption for the general public. This situation is synonymous to the situation where the dog graduated but has since retired. Therefore, knowing the context of the organization behind this data, we can and should classify these three dogs as having the status of “Retired”.\n",

    "When we needed to change a the status value of a certain dog in the data cleaning of the original dataset, it was small enough to navigate by hand, so we went into the csv file and manually switched the status of these special-case dogs from whatever they once were (retired/in training/in-class. etc) to Graduated (or in the case of these three dogs, Retired). However, our new dataset is expanded, and doing this change by hand is more prone to cause errors. Therefore, we achieve the exact same thing by using the `.loc[]` function, as shown below. We know we changed the statuses successfully because if we rerean the block of code above, no dogs will be listed."

In the time that has passed since the last update, Nixie and Ulysses have finished their class, and their status has been updated to \"Graduated\".

The dataframe as it currently exists combines dogs that both have and have not taken the test. In order to train potential models (i.e. regressions) that could predict the success or failure of dogs who have yet to take the test based off information from dogs who have taken the test, we therefore need to split this dataset into two dataframes: (1) one including dogs who have taken the test and have receievd their results and (2) the other including dogs who have yet to take the test.\n",
